# House Price Pridictor
 A comprehensive project on house price prediction using a variety of techniques in Python.
 
HousePricePredictor is built using Python and scikit-learn. It aims to provide accurate predictions of house prices using a RandomForestRegressor model. This repository contains all the necessary code and instructions to train the model, evaluate its performance.

 ## Model
The model used in this project is a RandomForestRegressor while other two models which are Linear regressor model and Descion Tree model are also mentioned in the code file and their outputs are also attached in Different Models Output Folder. RandomForestRegressor was chosen for its ability to handle complex datasets and provide accurate predictions. The model is trained on the Boston housing dataset and saved as house_price_predictor.joblib.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using cross-validation and mean squared error (MSE). The results show that the RandomForestRegressor performs well in predicting house prices, with a low root mean squared error (RMSE).
